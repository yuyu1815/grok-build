//! Leader-mode PTY e2e tests, split out of the shared `pty_e2e` target.
//!
//! These cases spawn multi-process leader clusters (each test boots 2-3 full
//! pager processes plus a leader subprocess), so running them interleaved
//! with the ~45-test `pty_e2e` suite was the root of the 60→240s
//! `LEADER_TIMEOUT` flake history. As their own `[[test]]` target they get
//! their own Bazel test action (serialized from the main PTY pool) and can be
//! invoked in isolation:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test -p xai-grok-pager --test leader_pty_e2e -- --ignored --test-threads=1 --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Binary resolution and harness plumbing are identical to `pty_e2e` (see
//! that target's `mod.rs`); the shared helpers these tests need live in this
//! directory's `common.rs`.
